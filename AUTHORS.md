This list is originally compiled by @erikr, based on experiences from attending many conferences, and co-organising Django Under the Hood in 2014 together the stellar @bmispelon, @olasitarska and @mjtamlyn. In other words, although I did compile this list, most of the recommendations would not exist without the hard work of many others.

Some conferences that inspired items on this list are [Django Circus](http://love.djangocircus.com) in Poland, [Django Island](http://2014.djangocon.eu) in France and [mdevcon](http://mdevcon.com).

Note that the conferences and people mentioned do not necessarily endorse this list.
